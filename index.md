Hi! My name is Artem, and I'm web developer, ideas generator and lifehacker. Today I focused on the ReactJS, but have over 8 years experience in web development. 
I started with my pet projects like [avto-57.ru](http://avto-57.ru) and [oorel.ru](http://oorel.ru), few years I was a freelancer, then worked on document and task management web-system in ![DV logo](http://artemgrinn.github.io/assets/images/dv.png) [Docsvision](http://www.docsvision.com/products/legkiy-klient/). 


Now I'm developing a [system](https://travel.payps.ru/bilet) for booking air tickets on credit and other products in PayPS. Also I'm one of the organizers of ![OrelJS logo](http://artemgrinn.github.io/assets/images/oreljs.svg) [OrelJS Meetup](http://oreljs.ru).
